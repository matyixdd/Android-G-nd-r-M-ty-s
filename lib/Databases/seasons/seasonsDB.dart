        "¼ cup extra virgin olive oil\n1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped\n2 carrots, peeled and chopped\n4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced\n2 teaspoons ground cumin\n1 teaspoon curry powder\n½ teaspoon dried thyme\n1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, lightly drained\n1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed\n4 cups vegetable broth\n2 cups water\n1 teaspoon salt, more to taste\nPinch of red pepper flakes\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\n1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed\n1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ to 1 medium lemon), to taste",
    "process":
        "Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. \nOne-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.\nOnce the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. \nPour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.\nPour in the lentils, broth and the water. \nAdd 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. \nRaise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. \nCook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.\nTransfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. \nSecurely fasten the lid, protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid, and purée the soup until smooth. \nPour the puréed soup back into the pot. \n(Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)\nAdd the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to your liking. \nRemove the pot from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. \nFor spicier soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.\nServe while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before serving)."

Combine the onions, balsamic, half the marjoram and 50g of butter in a baking tray. \nBake for 35-40 minutes until soft.\n3. To make the pasta, place flour on a work surface, make a well in centre and crack eggs into well. \nGradually mix flour into eggs with your hands to form a firm dough. \nKnead for 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. \nCover with a tea towel and set aside for 20 minutes.\n4. Place cooked potato (unpeeled) in a bowl and mash with a fork. \nOnce it starts to break up a little, add cooked onions and any pan juices. \nAdd pecorino, season with salt and pepper (I also add a splash of my best olive oil at this stage) and fold in rocket. \nThe mixture needs to be bashed up enough to fit into the ravioli.\n5. Roll out pasta in a pasta machine, starting with the widest setting and working down to the thinnest, until you have six 30cm long, very thin sheets. \nFold each sheet in half lengthways and open up again so you have a divider down the centre. \nSpace 3 tablespoonfuls of filling along one side of the sheet, then brush around filling with beaten egg. \nFold the other side of the pasta sheet over the fillings and press down with your fingers to remove any air. \nCut each square roughly to give a rustic look. Repeat for remaining pasta sheets and filling.\n6. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. \nPlunge ravioli into the boiling water in batches and cook until they float to the surface, they should take less than 1 minute. \nAt the same time, place a frypan (large enough to hold all the ravioli comfortably) over high heat with remaining marjoram, butter and 2 tablespoons of pasta water. \nJiggle pan a little to combine the butter and water.\n7. As the ravioli are cooked, transfer to the frypan using a slotted spoon. \nOnce all ravioli are in the frypan, season the butter sauce over low heat and stir gently to coat ravioli, adding a little more pasta cooking water if necessary. \nServe immediately with extra pecorino."

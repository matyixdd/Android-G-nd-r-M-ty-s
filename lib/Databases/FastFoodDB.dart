        " 10 clams (vongole), rinsed well and kept in the fridge in a bowl of cold salted water\n6 green tiger prawns peeled, deveined\n10 mussels, cleaned, debearded\nFlat-leaf parsley leaves, to garnish\nPIZZA DOUGH\n7g sachet dried yeast\n1 tsp sugar\n2 2/3 cups (400g) plain flour\n1/3 cup (50g) spelt or wholemeal flour\nCoarse semolina, to dust (optional)\nTOMATO BASE\n2 tbs extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to drizzle\n3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n1-2 tbs finely chopped flat-leaf parsley stalks\n1 tsp chilli flakes (optional)\n150ml white wine\n400g can crushed tomatoes",
    "process":
        " 1.Combine the yeast with sugar and 220ml warm water in a bowl and stand for 5 minutes or until frothy. Place the flours in a large mixing bowl, pour in the yeast mixture and knead until combined, then add 2 tsp salt. Turn out onto a floured work surface and knead vigorously for up to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth, shiny and elastic. Add a little water if the dough feels too dry, but keep in mind that the more you knead it, the softer it becomes. (Alternatively, place the flours in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, pour in the yeast mixture and let the machine work the dough on speed 1 for the first 2 minutes. Increase to speed 2 for 3-5 minutes, then work for 30 seconds on the highest setting.) Tip the dough onto a floured surface, cover with a tea towel and rest for 30 minutes.\n2.Stretch the dough with floured hands into a rectangle, then fold into 3 and shape into a ball. Place in an oiled container fitted with a lid. Make sure you use a large container that will allow room for rising. Rest the container in the fridge overnight (or for up to 3 days) to prove and develop flavour and texture.\n3.A couple of hours before you want to use the dough, remove it from the fridge and take off the lid. Cover loosely with a tea towel and leave at room temperature for 2 hours.\n4.Meanwhile, prepare your tomato base (this can also be made the day before and kept in the fridge until ready to use). Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the garlic, parsley stalks and chilli flakes (if using) and cook for 1 minute or until the garlic is light golden and smells fragrant. Pour in the wine and cook over medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes until the alcohol has evaporated. Add the tomatoes with a pinch of salt and simmer for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside until ready to use.\n5.Preheat your oven to 220°C. If you are using a pizza stone, put it in the oven now. For this recipe I like to use a large rectangular stone, but you could also use two small ones. Naturally, round baking stones are fine too.\n6.Divide the dough into 2 pieces and roll out the dough to a thickness of about 4mm, using either a floured rolling pin or your hands. If baking on a stone, place the dough on a sheet of baking paper. Otherwise, put the dough on a large baking tray lined with baking paper (you may need to use two trays, depending on the size of your oven). Spread the tomato base onto the dough and drizzle an extra 1-2 tbs olive oil all over the pizza.\n7.If using a baking stone, sprinkle the stone with semolina, then place the pizza (still on its baking paper lining) on the hot stone. Bake for 15 minutes.\n8.Meanwhile, rinse the clams again and drain them well. Gently open the door, peel the paper off the pizza base and add the seafood. Bake for a further 5-8 minutes until the base is golden and slightly scorched, the shells have opened and the prawns are just cooked through. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of parsley leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. (If you are using a baking tray, place the tray in the hot oven and bake for 15 minutes. Add the seafood and bake as above.)"

        "1. Heat butter and oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add bacon, onion, garlic and Tuscan seasoning. Cook for 6-7 minutes until onion is softened. Remove from heat, season and add herbs, lemon zest and breadcrumbs. Cool, then crumble in mince, add 1 egg and mix well. Season, halve mixture and set aside.\n2. Preheat oven to 200°C. Grease 2 large oven trays and line with baking paper. Shape half the mince along the centre of a puff pastry sheet into a 5cm-thick log. Brush edges with eggwash and roll up to enclose filling. Brush with eggwash and evenly place five sage leaves on top. Place a sheet of filo on a clean work surface, brush with melted butter and season. Place sausage roll on top sage-side up and parallel to a short edge. Trim filo to match length of sausage roll. Roll up tightly to enclose in a single layer. Trim excess filo. Place on prepared tray seam-side down with sage leaves on top. Brush with melted butter and scatter with sea salt flakes. Repeat with remaining pastry sheet, mince mixture and filo pastry. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden.\n3. For gravy, heat butter in a small non-stick saucepan. When it foams, add flour and stir for 3-4 minutes until deep golden. Gradually whisk in stock until smooth. Reduce heat to very low and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.\n4. Cut sausage rolls into desired pieces and serve with gravy."

Add the cabbage and spices and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-6 minutes or until cabbage is wilted and cooked down. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, herbs and mustard seeds. Season to taste. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, for 8-10 minutes or until cabbage is cooked down with only a little bit of moisture. You want your cabbage to be nice and dry. Set aside to cool completely.\n2. Preheat oven to 220°C. Grease 2 large oven trays and line with baking paper. Cut each pastry sheet in half. Working with 1 half at a time, evenly spread 2 tsp of mustard the same size as chorizo in the centre, leaving at least a 3cm border so you can seal with the other half of the pastry sheet when ready to enclose. Evenly spread 2 tbs of the cabbage mixture over the top of the mustard,, then scatter with 2 tbs of cheese\n3. Place the chorizo over the cheese and brush the border with egg wash. Cover with the remaining pastry half, pressing down firmly on the edges to enclose. Trim pastry so you have a 2cm edge around the chorizo. Discard trimmed pastry. Using a sharp knife, make three incisions that cut three-quarters through the pastry and sausage, taking care not to cut through the base. Insert a rosemary sprig then a bay leaf into each incision. Repeat with remaining pastry and filling.\n4. Place sausage rolls on prepared oven trays and brush pastry with egg wash. Season and bake, rotating between shelves if needed, for 30-35 minutes or until pastry is golden and cooked."

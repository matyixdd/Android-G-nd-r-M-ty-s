        "Lay out all your ingredients. Line either two 6-inch cake pans with parchment paper (rims and bottom) or one 8-inch cake pan. A 10-inch cake pan will result in a flatter cake. Separate 6 eggs. \nPlace the egg whites in a mixer bowl.\nPre-heat oven to 325-340F depending on your oven. Prepare bain-marie (baking dish with about 1/2 inch of water, or a little more).\nIn a pot over low heat, add the cream cheese, butter, and 1/4 cup of fine sugar. \nMix until everything is smooth and creamy. \nThen add in the egg yolks. \nMix again until creamy before adding all the cornstarch and flour.\nMix 1 tbsp of matcha powder (ceremonial is best but it’s expensive) with 3 tbsp water or milk. \nAdd the matcha mixture into the pot and mix again before adding the milk.\nMix everything together. Vanilla extract is optional— you can add a splash.\nSet the batter aside and beat your egg whites into stiff peaks, starting at medium speed. \nWhen you see some foam, add the cream of tartar (or vinegar or lemon juice.) Only add the 1/4 sugar gradually after the egg whites become white and foamier.\nBeating the egg whites will take a while (8-12 minutes). Gradually increase your mixer speed. \nIf you under-beat, your cake will be flat.\nTake a large scoop of egg white and mix it (with a hand whisk) with the cake batter. \nYou need to incorporate it fully but don’t go too hard or else the batter will become too water. \nDo this two more times before pouring all of the batter into the rest of the egg whites.\nFold and mix gently but make sure your final batter is a smooth, creamy, lava-like batter that pours slowly onto the cake pans. \nFill the cake pans to the rims and smooth out the top with your whisk.\nBake for 25 minutes at 325F-340F, and watch for the cake to rise. \nIf the cake does not rise at all, the temperature is too low, or you have under-beaten your egg whites, or over-mixed your final batter. \nAfter 25 minutes, open the oven door for 10 seconds, and lower the temperature to 245-265F, again depending on your oven. Bake for an additional 45 minutes.\nTurn off the heat and leave the cakes to cool in the oven for about 10 minutes.\nRemove from oven with oven mitts, flip them over, enjoy the bouncy jiggles (as I have) and eat!

For an extra layer of nutty flavor, sprinkle the inside of the pan with almond flour and turn the pan to coat evenly; shake out any excess. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread level with a spatula.\nBake the cake for 50 to 60 minutes. When done, a cake tester, long toothpick, or strand of uncooked spaghetti will come out clean when inserted into the center. \nRemove the cake from the oven.\nLeave the cake in the pan to cool slightly while you make the syrup.\nTo make the syrup: In a medium-sized saucepan combine the syrup ingredients, except vanilla. \nBring to a rapid boil then reduce to a simmer and cook (without stirring) for about 5 to 8 minutes, until the syrup thickens slightly. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.\nUse a long skewer to poke holes all over the cake. Pour about 1/4 cup of the syrup over the cake (still in the pan). Allow the syrup to soak in, then repeat again and again until all the syrup is used.\nCover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and allow the cake to sit overnight at room temperature to cool completely and soak in the syrup. When ready to serve, loosen the edges of the cake and invert onto your serving plate. If the cake won’t release, don't force it. Place it in the oven, turn the oven to 350°F, and warm for about 10 minutes, to soften the sticky syrup. (If your oven is one that preheats by making its upper element red-hot, place the cake on a lower rack and tent it with aluminum foil to protect it.) Remove the cake from the oven, and tip it onto the serving plate.\nServe with hot coffee or tea. The cake is very moist, fragrant and potent.\nWrap securely (or place under a cake cover) and store at room temperature for several days. \nFreeze for longer storage, up to 1 month."

Meanwhile, half-fill a small saucepan or deep-fryer with sunflower oil and heat to 180°C (a cube of bread will turn golden in 30 seconds when the oil is hot enough). Fry wonton wrappers, one at a time, for 30 seconds (turning once) until crisp, then carefully remove with tongs or a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. When cool enough to handle, break into large pieces.\n3. Heat a 20cm non-stick frypan or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease pan with melted butter or oil spray. Pour 50ml (2 1/2 tablespoons) crepe mixture in the pan, tilting to coat the base. Cook for 1 minute or until golden, then flip the crepe over.\n4. Crack an egg onto the crepe, then use a spatula to gently break up the egg and smear it over the surface of the crepe. Sprinkle with some spring onion and fried wonton wrapper. Fold the crepe in half, then smear 1 teaspoon hoisin over the top and sprinkle with some of the chilli. Finally, fold in half again to form a triangle. Remove from the frypan and keep warm while you make remaining pancakes. Just before serving, drizzle with extra hoisin, if desired, and top with extra spring onion."

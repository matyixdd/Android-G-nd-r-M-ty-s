Continue to whisk until cooled and combined. Set aside. Place the thickened cream in the cleaned bowl of a stand mixer and whisk to soft peaks. Fold gently into the egg mixture, followed by cherry jam (you want this to form a ripple effect). Line the base and side of a 25cm (1.5 Lt capacity) springform pan with baking paper. Pour the mixture into the pan and wrap with plastic wrap and freeze overnight to set. Preheat oven to 220°C.\n2. For the roast cherries, place cherries in a roasting pan and scatter over sugar, zest and juice. Roast for 20-25 minutes or until cherries are roasted and syrupy.

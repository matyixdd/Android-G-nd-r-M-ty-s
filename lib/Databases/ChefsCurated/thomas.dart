    "process":
        "For the tapioca:\nSoak the tapioca in 1 cup of the milk for 1 hour. (Setting it in a warm place will speed up the rehydration of the pearls.)\nFor the oysters:\nShuck the oysters. Trim away the muscle and the outer ruffled edge of each oyster and place the trimmings in a saucepan. Reserve the whole trimmed oysters and strain the oyster juice into a separate bowl. You should have about 1/2 cup of juice.\nTo cook the tapioca:\nIn a bowl, whip 1/2 cup of the cream just until it holds its shape; reserve in the refrigerator.\nDrain the softened tapioca in a strainer and discard the milk. Rinse the tapioca under cold running water, then place it in a small heavy pot.\nPour the remaining 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup cream over the oyster trimmings. Bring to a simmer, then strain the infused liquid onto the tapioca. Discard the trimmings.\nCook the tapioca over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until it has thickened and the spoon leaves a trail when it is pulled through, 7 to 8 minutes. Continue to cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the tapioca has no resistance in the center and is translucent. The mixture will be sticky and if you lift some on the spoon and let it fall, some should still cling to the spoon. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside in a warm place."

Use an instant read thermometer to to keep it under 180 F.\nAdd defrosted, raw tails. Cook for 6-8 minutes and turn tails in butter mixture. Again, make sure the butter does not come to a boil, reduce the heat if necessary. Be careful not to overcook lobster. Poached lobster tails should have an an internal temperature of about 140-145°"

    "process":
        "Preheat the oven to 450°F. \nRinse the chicken, then dry it very well with paper towels, inside and out. \nThe less it steams, the drier the heat, the better.\nSalt and pepper the cavity, then truss the bird. \nTrussing is not difficult, and if you roast chicken often, it's a good technique to feel comfortable with. \nWhen you truss a bird, the wings and legs stay close to the body; the ends of the drumsticks cover the top of the breast and keep it from drying out. \nTrussing helps the chicken to cook evenly, and it also makes for a more beautiful roasted bird.\nNow, salt the chicken—I like to rain the salt over the bird so that it has a nice uniform coating that will result in a crisp, salty, flavorful skin (about 1 tablespoon). \nWhen it's cooked, you should still be able to make out the salt baked onto the crisp skin. \nSeason to taste with pepper.\nPlace the chicken in a sauté pan or roasting pan and, when the oven is up to temperature, put the chicken in the oven. \nI leave it alone—I don't baste it, I don't add butter; \nyou can if you wish, but I feel this creates steam, which I don't want.\nRoast it until it's done, 50 to 60 minutes. \nRemove it from the oven and add the thyme, if using, to the pan. \nBaste the chicken with the juices and thyme and let it rest for 15 minutes on a cutting board.\nRemove the twine. \nSeparate the middle wing joint and eat that immediately.\nRemove the legs and thighs. \nI like to take off the backbone and eat one of the oysters, the two succulent morsels of meat embedded here, and give the other to the person I'm cooking with. \nBut I take the chicken butt for myself. \nI could never understand why my brothers always fought over that triangular tip—until one day I got the crispy, juicy fat myself. \nThese are the cook's rewards. \nCut the breast down the middle and serve it on the bone, with one wing joint still attached to each. \nThe preparation is not meant to be superelegant. \nSlather the meat with fresh butter. \nServe with mustard on the side and, if you wish, a simple green salad. \nYou'll start using a knife and fork, but finish with your fingers, because it's so good."

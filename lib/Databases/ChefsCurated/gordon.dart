        "1 (2 lb.) center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed\nkosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nOlive oil, for greasing\n2 tbsp. Dijon mustard\n1 1/2 lb. mixed mushrooms, roughly chopped\n1 shallot, roughly chopped\nLeaves from 1 thyme sprig\n2 tbsp. unsalted butter\n12 thin slices prosciutto\nFlour, for dusting\n14 oz. frozen puff pastry, thawed\n1 large egg, beaten\nFlaky salt, for sprinkling",
    "process":
        "Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper.\nOver high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.\nMeanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.\nTo skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then let cool in fridge.\nPlace plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto.\nSeason tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).\nHeat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry.\nOnce the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.\nRemove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt.\nBake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before carving and serving."

        "Stuffing for Pork Tenderloin:\nPreheat oven to 400˚F. In an oven-safe large skillet over medium heat, add 2 Tbsp oil with chopped bacon and and cook until browned (3-4 minutes). Add sliced mushrooms and chopped onion and sauté 5 minutes or until soft. \nSeason with 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, chopped parsley and minced garlic. Cook another minute stirring constantly then transfer to a plate. \nHow to Stuff Pork Tenderloin\nRemove Silver Skin from Pork Tenderloin. Cut a slit all the way down the long end of your tenderloin, making sure not to cut all the way through. Open tenderloin like a book, cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until 1/2 thick without tearing through the meat. \nSpread mushroom mixture evenly over the surface of the tenderloin, leaving 1/2 at the borders. Roll tightly starting with the long end (hot-dog style) and secure the ends with 6-7 toothpicks. Poke toothpicks through parallel to each other to create a flat cooking surface. Season all over with 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. \nHeat the same skillet over medium heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, place tenderloin in the skillet (toothpick-side-down) and sear about 2 minutes per side (6-8 minutes total). Transfer the skillet with the tenderloin to the oven and bake at 400˚F for 18-20 min or until an instant read thermometer reads 145-150˚F in the thickest portion of the meat.\nTransfer to a cutting board, brush with the pan drippings and rest 10 minutes before slicing into rings. Brush with pan drippings for more flavor and garnish with parsley if desired.",

Coat the fish cakes in seasoned flour, then dip into the egg and finally into the breadcrumbs, turning to coat evenly all over. Reshape them as necessary and place on a tray or plate. Chill for 2 hours to set the shape.\nTo cook, heat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Heat a thin layer of olive oil in a wide ovenproof frying pan.
